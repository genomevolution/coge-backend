' MinIO Service detailed connections
note right of MinIOSvc
  **MinIO Operations:**
  • Upload files (.fa, .fasta, .fna, .gff3, .gff)
  • Download files
  • Delete files
  • Generate presigned URLs
  • File path generation
  • Bucket management
end note

' File flow
note top of GenomeUploadSvc
  **File Upload Flow:**
  1. Validate file type
  2. Generate file path
  3. Upload to MinIO
  4. Store metadata in DB
  5. Create file-genome link
  6. Generate download URL
end note

note top of AnnotationUploadSvc
  **Annotation Upload Flow:**
  1. Validate file type (.gff3, .gff)
  2. Generate file path
  3. Upload to MinIO
  4. Create annotation record
  5. Store file metadata
  6. Create annotation-file link
end note

' API Endpoints
note bottom of FastAPI
  **Key Endpoints:**
  • GET /genomes/ - List genomes
  • GET /genomes/{id} - Get genome details
  • POST /organisms/{id}/genomes/{id}/upload - Upload genome
  • POST /organisms/{id}/genomes/{id}/annotations/upload - Upload annotation
  • GET /files/download - Download file
  • DELETE /files/delete - Delete file
end note
